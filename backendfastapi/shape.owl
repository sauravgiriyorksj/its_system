  <description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A triangle is a three-sided polygon that is one of the most fundamental shapes in geometry. It is defined by three vertices connected by three straight sides. Triangles are categorized based on their sides (equilateral, isosceles, scalene) or angles (acute, obtuse, right). They divide a plane into two regions: interior and exterior. Triangles are studied for their properties and play a significant role in engineering, design, and mathematics. They are also used to derive trigonometric principles.</description>
  <property rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The sum of a triangle's interior angles is always 180 degrees. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Triangles can be inscribed in a circle (circumcircle) or have a circle inscribed inside them (incircle). Key centers like the centroid, orthocenter, circumcenter, and incenter play vital roles in geometric calculations.</property>
  <application rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Triangles are essential in engineering for creating stable structures like trusses and bridges. They are widely used in architecture for their strength and stability. In computer graphics, they form the basic units of 3D modeling. In mathematics, they are foundational for trigonometry and geometry. Triangles are used in navigation and astronomy to calculate distances using triangulation. Their simplicity and versatility make them indispensable in both theoretical and practical applications.</application>
